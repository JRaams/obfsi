### CS:GO Operation Broken Fang Shop Inspector

This projects aims to (WIP):

1. Fetch and store recent Steam market prices for items in the CS:GO operation Broken Fang star shop using a [market-spider](./market-spider/README.md) written in golang.
2. Distribute these prices using a Polka GraphQL API. **(TODO)**
3. Show the star-per-dollar (or Euro) value of each item in the operation shop via a Svelte/Sapper frontend site. **(TODO)**
